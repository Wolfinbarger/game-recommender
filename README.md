# Game Recommender
A full-stack web app that helps you discover awesome games to play with your friends or solo.

## Description
Game Recommender helps users find new games to play, both with friends or solo, by analyzing the user's gaming
preferences and providing results using our enriched dataset. Whether they're looking for a casual party game, 
a thrilling adventure game, or a challenging strategy game, this app has them covered. After the user enters their
preferences, this app will show them a list of games that match their criteria. 

In our project's future state, they can also read reviews, watch trailers, and compare prices from different platforms. 
Our dataset uses multiple data sources, such as datasets on Kaggle, official store APIs, and custom web scrapers.

* [React](https://react.dev/) - Front-end
